Describe any additional functionality you added to your application, or any
significant changes you made to the starter code beyond the basic requirements
of the assignment, below:

I add another button under the text box of EdgeList called "clear Text box". The clear Text box button just clear the text box,
and don't do any change to the edge already in canvas, which means when pressing the button text in the textbox disappear
and the drawing remain unchanged.

Difference between "clear Text box" and "clear" is that clear change the graph, not the text in the textbox and clear text box
change the text in textbox, not the graph.
